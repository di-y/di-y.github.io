> **Where have I been - Past**

Hello World, I hope everyone reading this post is living a balanced, purposeful and a healthy life. For me, its been a mix of everything, past three months have been fast, engaging, ups, downs, insightful, aaahh, difficult to summarise. So it started this way - The last blog post I wrote, I was in Bangalore working with OLA Cabs, then got in touch with some awesome people, precisely from **[SocialCops](https://socialcops.com/home)**, had some round of discussions, left my job at Bangalore, landed at Delhi, and here I am now, working with some of the smartest minds towards one common goal, helping some important people take smart and data driven decisions. I have completed almost two and a half months here and its been one amazing ride. Will cover this journey with SocialCops in another blog post. Bangalore was one beautiful place, the days and the memories of which can never be blurred.

**Work** - I am the only hurdle. Its true. Plenty of opportunities, lots of ideas, and no dearth of resources. Creating things is what I love, and given the position I am currently in, could have not asked for more. Things will move fast, learning quickly and moving on, be smart, proactive and resourceful, question everything, think collectively, appreciate and implement, these are some things I learnt in this short period. There were some failures and some have been to the point where I was questioning myself rigorously, but for the longer term my task will be to develop these failures into pillars and not cracks. There were several goodies as well, every project we undertake at SocialCops is tough and impactful, and I was involved in some of them, worked around several datasets, some so insightful, the moment you get your hands on it, ideas start flowing. Our government has a goldmine in terms of useful data and we are sitting on top of this mine, need to dig some jewels out. There are weekend hacks as well, <a href="http://railways.socialcops.com" target="_blank">Indian Railways Network Hack</a> was one of them, the end product was awesome. Check it out. It lets you explore aprrox 3000 railway routes, there are some insights around the most loved form of transport as well.

**Life** - A move to a new city, which is a bit polluted, but its ok, makes up for the food :). Bangalore Football club is what I miss, ohh I loved the atmosphere of West Block A, but a couple of trips to India Gate, late at night, walking the old streets coupled with the some iconic roads, amazing bunch of friends, metro rides, lots of tea(Ill stop, I know) and a tea with Pintu Bhaiya some Carls Jr Burgers, all nighters at our SocialCops headquarters, new gym, Parathas with butter, a completely different and insightful trip to Nagpur, some new interests, new habits, new books, and a lovely resting place. This summarises my stay till today in this beautiful city. 

Been discovering a lot about myself, the people around, choices, needs, importance, priorities, from inside Ive started to feel closer to nature, appreciating even the smallest of smallest of leaf(sounds weird but this makes me happy), observing the space, and believe me, if you can just get the perspective of this huge, incomparable and wide universe and us (smaller than  1/1000th of a grain of rice), this will itself definitely turn you into a better human being. 

> **Treasure box** 

 Through this period, I came across several good books, people, podcasts, which have helped me to calm myself down and be present in time, keep myself healthy and happy and concentrate more. Listing some of them here:

**Books**( *read or somewhat read but found useful*)-

1. Siddhartha - Hermann Hesse
2. Tuesdays with Morrie - Mitch Albom
3. Elon Musk - Ashlee Vance
4. Thinking Fast and Slow -  Daniel Kahneman
5. Into the Wild - John Krauker
6. Cosmos - Carl Sagan
7. For the love of Physics - Walter Lewin
8. Zero to One - Peter Thiel
9. Bushcraft - Richard Graves


**Podcasts** - 

1. The Tim Ferris Show - I love this one, the best I have ever heard
2. Partially Derivative - Related to Data Science
3. Talk Python to me - Technical - Python Programming


I personally recommend the [The Tim Ferris Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) - to everyone, he hosts some amazing people our generation has and there are lots and lots of takeaways, I feel richer at the end of every episode. Some of my favourite episodes from this show are:

1. [Naval Ravikant on Happiness Hacks and the 5 Chimps Theory](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/01/30/naval-ravikant-on-happiness-hacks/)
2. [Derek Sivers Reloaded - On Success Habits and Billionaires with Perfect Abs](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/28/derek-sivers-reloaded-on-success-habits-and-billionaires-with-perfect-abs/)

Do check these out for some real insights to life and yourself. 

> **Things to look forward to -**

Been planning some projects around data science, visualisations and IOT(common its fun). Will try to keep myself and this blog updated more frequently. I am also looking forward for some good use cases related to agriculture, disaster management, water, food, anything which is primitive. If you have ideas, just ping me on twitter, gmail, anywhere. Lets discuss them and build a practical tool out of it. It can be anything, lets apply our engineering minds for something good and useful.
